# 🌍 Golang Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my personal archive of competitive programming problems — all solved in pure **Golang** 🐹⚔️.  
This repo is organized by **problem type** and **algorithmic approach**, not by platform. Whether it's from Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, or CSES, if it made me think — it's in here.

---

## 💡 Why Golang?

- ⚡ Blazingly fast execution and compilation
- 🧠 Forces clean, performant logic
- 🛠️ Powerful standard library (maps, slices, etc.)
- 👾 Great for both systems-level thinking and high-level strategy

---

## 🗂️ Structure

All problems are inside the `CP-problems/` directory, categorized by topic:
```
CP-problems/
 ├── implementation/    
 ├── greedy/ 
 ├── binary-search/ 
 ├── dfs-bfs/ 
 ├── math/ 
 ├── dp/ 
 └── ...more coming
```

Each subfolder contains `.go` files named after the problem + optional metadata in comments.
